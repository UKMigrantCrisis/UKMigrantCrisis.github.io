<h1>Per capita Prison Population based on the information</h1>
<p>As of 2022, the prison population in the United Kingdom was approximately 89,863, according to data from <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/314700/uk-prison-population/">Statista</a>. This figure reflects a significant increase over the past decades, with the prison population in England and Wales alone rising by 80 percent in the last 30 years. Factors contributing to this growth include longer average prison sentences and an increase in the number of individuals held on remand or recalled to custody. The UK now has one of the highest incarceration rates in Western Europe, prompting discussions on prison reform and the need for alternative sentencing strategies.</p>
