  <h1>Brexit: The Pros, Cons, and the Ongoing Reality – Is It Working Out?</h1>
  <p>When the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union in 2016, it marked one of the most significant political decisions in recent British history. Years later, the effects of Brexit continue to unfold, sparking debate across the country. Supporters argue it has restored sovereignty and control over borders, while critics highlight economic struggles and trade disruptions. In this blog, we’ll explore the key positives and negatives of Brexit and ask the crucial question: is it truly working out the way the nation hoped?
</p>
<br>
  <h2>Did Brexit Really Restore Control Over the UK’s Borders?</h2>
<p>The promise to “take back control” of the UK’s borders was one of the defining messages of the Brexit campaign. Supporters argued that leaving the European Union would allow Britain to implement its own immigration policies, free from EU laws on freedom of movement. But nearly a decade since the referendum, has the UK truly regained control of its borders? The answer is mixed: in some ways, it has — but in other ways, it clearly hasn’t.</p>
<br>
<h3>Where Brexit Did Restore Border Control?</h3>
<p>One of the most tangible changes after Brexit is the end of automatic freedom of movement for EU citizens. Previously, nationals from EU countries could live and work in the UK without a visa. Since Brexit, they must now apply through the same points-based immigration system that non-EU nationals use. <br> <br>

This shift has had a noticeable effect. According to the Migration Observatory, 53% of EU citizens were refused entry to the UK in the years following Brexit. Additionally, EU migration to the UK has dropped sharply, reflecting a significant tightening of rules.<br> <br>

From a political and legal standpoint, the UK government now sets its own immigration criteria, independent of EU directives. It can prioritize skilled workers, limit entry numbers, and make its own decisions about who is allowed in. In this sense, Brexit has clearly given the UK more control over the rules governing its borders.</p>
<br>
<h3>Where Brexit Failed to Deliver Full Border Control?</h3>
<p>However, the broader picture shows that "control" doesn’t always mean “restriction.” Despite tougher rules for EU citizens, the number of people arriving in the UK seeking asylum has risen — and significantly so.<br> <br>

According to data from the Refugee Council, 85,112 asylum applications were made in the UK in the 12 months leading up to March 2025, involving 109,343 people. This marks a 15% increase compared to the previous year. Many of these individuals arrive through irregular means, such as crossing the English Channel in small boats — a growing concern for the government and the public.<br> <br>

This trend challenges the notion that post-Brexit Britain is in firm control of its borders. While legal migration from the EU has decreased, illegal or irregular migration — often more costly and politically controversial — has grown. The UK is now seen by many asylum seekers as a destination of choice, with open refugee policies that, paradoxically, undermine the very border control that Brexit was supposed to strengthen.<br> <br>

Moreover, critics argue that the current policy unfairly restricts economic migrants from the EU — who historically contributed to the UK economy — while allowing in asylum seekers who often require public support. This raises uncomfortable questions: What is the purpose of border control if the system turns away productive, skilled Europeans but accepts large numbers of refugees arriving via dangerous and illegal routes? </p><br>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>So, did Brexit restore control over the UK’s borders? Technically, yes — the UK now writes its own immigration rules and can choose who enters the country. But in practice, the outcomes are mixed. While EU migration has been curbed, the rise in asylum seekers and illegal crossings suggests that the UK still faces major challenges in enforcing its borders.<br> <br>

Ultimately, Brexit has shifted the type of migration rather than reducing it altogether. Whether that’s seen as a success or a failure depends on what kind of control voters were expecting — and whether the current system truly reflects their expectations.</p>
